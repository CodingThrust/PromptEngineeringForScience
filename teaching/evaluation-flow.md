# Example 1: AMAT5315 - Modern Scientific Computing
## Merge PRs to this repo
**Human**: Clone the homework repo to this working directory.

```
Merge PRs to this repo, use gh.

Requirements: 
1. each user has his own folder, the PR is only allowed to modify the owner's folder.
2. some users may submit multiple PRs that may lead to conflicts, please merge the most suited one.
3. use squash and merge
4. no files larger than 10M.

For PRs hard to decide, list them in chat.
```

## Analyze submissions

```
Read all readmes in each assignment folder, try to generate answers.
```

Best practise: make an example
```
Base on the submissions, for student XXX, make a table, rows are assignments, cols are the following facts
1. For coding, execution output is included? Note: some outputs are in markdown, some are in images.
2. The first submission of each assignment?
3. Detect if a submission is AI generated
4. Correctness (0-100)
5. Completeness (0-100)
```

**Human**: check the output, if everything is good, continue
```
Implement the same for other students, and summarize the results into a markdown file.
```

## Score

```
based on the generated markdown file, rank students:
- A+: best 1-2
- A: <30%
- A-: 30-40%
- B+: 40%-70
- B: 70%-93%
- B-: 93%-100%

First submission should have doubled.
For AI submission, the score should be halved.
