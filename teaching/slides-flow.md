# Generate slides

_Remark_: It is important to make a template slides for chapter 1, so the AI can follow the style. I recommend using text based typst.

(Human)

> prepare a lecture pdf, or a chapter in a textbook <chapter.pdf>, and a template file <slides.typ>.

The chapter pdf can be split from a textbook. AI can not read large PDF files.

(Prompt)

```
Generate slides for lecture <chapter.pdf>, in typst format.
- based on <slides.typ>
```
