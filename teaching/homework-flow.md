## Tips

1. **Reference standards**: Always point to an existing homework as template
2. **Keep scripts simple**: Students should focus on learning, not setup
3. **Avoid redundancy**: Check what's already covered in class
4. **Batch polish**: Once standards are established, apply to all assignments
