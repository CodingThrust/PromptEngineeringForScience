# Prompt Engineering For Science

Human-AI collaboration workflows for scientific tasks.

## Philosophy
- _Be open_: Be open to potential solutions. Do not preassume the solution, just describe what you need!
- _Manage context_: Keep all relevant information in your workspace. Refer to the most helpful information when needed, e.g. package source code, previous examples, etc.

## Flows

| Category | Flows |
|----------|-------|
| [Paper Writing](paper-writing/flow.md) | Literature → Plan → Draft → Polish |
| [Coding](coding/coding-flow.md) | Build · Debug · Explain |
| [Research](research/flow.md) | Literature review · Gap identification |
| [Teaching](teaching/) | [Slides](teaching/slides-flow.md) · [Quiz](teaching/quiz-flow.md) · [Homework](teaching/homework-flow.md) · [Exam](teaching/exam-flow.md) · [Evaluation](teaching/evaluation-flow.md) |

### Univeral workflow
1. **Human prepares** → materials, context
2. **AI generates** → drafts, suggestions
3. **Human reviews** → quality control
4. **Iterate** → "fix", "simplify", "continue"
