# Prompt Engineering For Science

Human-AI collaboration workflows for scientific and academic tasks. Each flow provides a step-by-step path for humans to follow when interacting with AI.

## Flows

| Category | Flows | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| [Paper Writing](paper-writing/flow.md) | Paper Draft Flow | From raw notes to polished manuscript |
| [Coding](coding/coding-flow.md) | Vibe Coding | AI-assisted programming workflows |
| [Research](research/flow.md) | Discovery & Planning | Literature review, gap identification, methodology |
| [Data Analysis](data-analysis/flow.md) | Analysis Pipelines | EDA, statistics, ML, reproducibility |
| [Teaching](teaching/) | [Slides](teaching/slides-flow.md) · [Exam](teaching/exam-flow.md) · [Evaluation](teaching/evaluation-flow.md) | Course material generation and grading |
| [Workflow Automation](workflow-automation/mcp-flow.md) | MCP Server | Building AI tool integrations |

## Philosophy

Unlike static prompt lists, **flows** are designed as structured paths that guide human-AI collaboration:

1. **Human prepares** → materials, context, constraints
2. **AI generates** → drafts, suggestions, alternatives  
3. **Human reviews** → quality control, direction changes
4. **Iterate** → refine until satisfied

## Best Practices

- **Prepare good inputs**: AI output quality depends on your input quality
- **Use examples**: Show AI the style/format you want (model papers, templates)
- **Verify everything**: Always fact-check AI-generated content
- **Stay in control**: Human judgment guides the process at each step
- **Iterate**: Use follow-up prompts to refine results
