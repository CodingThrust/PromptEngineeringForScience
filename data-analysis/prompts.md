## Tips for Data Analysis Prompts

1. **Describe Your Data**: Include variable types, sample size, and study design.
2. **State Your Goal**: Are you exploring, confirming, predicting, or explaining?
3. **Share Context**: What field are you in? What conventions apply?
4. **Include Output**: When troubleshooting, share actual results/error messages.
5. **Ask for Assumptions**: Always ask about assumptions for any suggested method.
6. **Request Alternatives**: Ask for multiple approaches to compare options.
7. **Verify Recommendations**: Double-check statistical advice against authoritative sources.
8. **Consider Effect Sizes**: Don't focus solely on p-values.
