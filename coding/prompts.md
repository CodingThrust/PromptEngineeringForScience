## Tips for Effective Coding Prompts

1. **Provide Context**: Include the programming language, libraries you're using, and scientific domain.
2. **Share Relevant Code**: Include the actual code snippets you're working with.
3. **Specify Constraints**: Mention performance requirements, compatibility needs, or style guidelines.
4. **Include Sample Data**: When relevant, provide example inputs and expected outputs.
5. **State Your Goal**: Explain what you're trying to achieve, not just what's wrong.
6. **Verify Generated Code**: Always test AI-generated code before using in production/research.
7. **Iterate**: Use follow-up prompts to refine and improve generated solutions.
