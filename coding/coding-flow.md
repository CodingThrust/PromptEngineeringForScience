# Vibe Coding

AI-assisted programming workflows.

---

## Case 1: Build from Scratch

**Human**: Describe what you want in natural language.

(Prompt)
```
Build a <project-description>.
- use <language/framework>
- <key requirements>
```

> Start minimal, iterate. Include example input/output if possible.

---

## Case 2: Debug

**Human**: Copy the error message.

(Prompt)
```
I got this error:
<error-message>

Fix it.
```

---

## Case 3: Explain

(Prompt)
```
Explain what this code does.
```

---

## Powerful Prompts

```
Make it work, then make it right, then make it fast.
```

```
What's the idiomatic way to do <task> in <language>?
```

## Tips

1. **Run the code**: Don't just read it
2. **Show examples**: Input/output beats long descriptions
3. **Keep files open**: AI uses open files as context
