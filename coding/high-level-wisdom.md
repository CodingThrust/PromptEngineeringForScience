# High-Level Wisdom for Vibe Coding

You still need fundamentals. Paradoxically, **conceptual understanding becomes more important** when you stop writing code—you need to recognize good solutions, catch AI mistakes, and guide AI toward better approaches.

> ⚠️ Unlike HPC concepts (MPI, OpenMP, CUDA) that AI readily suggests when needed, this high-level wisdom represents a **mindset** that doesn't emerge naturally from vibe coding alone. Invest in learning these fundamentals separately.

## Math & Domain Knowledge

- Domain-specific and outside the scope of this guide, but essential for validating AI output in your field.

---

## Algorithmic Thinking

- **Paradigms**: greedy, divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, backtracking, branch-and-bound
- **Optimization techniques**: linear/integer programming, convex optimization, heuristics (genetic algorithms, simulated annealing)
- Know when to suggest an approach to the AI vs. letting it choose.

---

## Computational Theory

- **Complexity**: time/space complexity, Big-O notation, amortized analysis
- **Hardness classes**: P, NP, NP-complete, NP-hard—know when a problem is fundamentally hard
- **Foundational concepts**: expression trees, automata, Turing completeness

---

## Modern Software Engineering

- **Tooling**: version control (git), code review, CI/CD pipelines, containerization
- **Methodologies**: agile, iterative development, test-driven development
- **Architecture**: modularity, separation of concerns, API design
