## Tips for Workflow Automation Prompts

1. **Describe Current Process**: Explain what you currently do step by step.
2. **Identify Pain Points**: What takes too long? What's error-prone? What do you forget?
3. **Specify Tools**: Mention what software/tools you already use.
4. **State Constraints**: Time available, technical skills, budget for tools.
5. **Start Small**: Automate one thing well before building complex systems.
6. **Document Your Systems**: Ask AI to help document workflows for consistency.
7. **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess whether automations still serve you.
8. **Balance Automation & Flexibility**: Not everything should be automated.
