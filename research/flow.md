# Research Discovery Flow

A structured workflow for AI-assisted research exploration.

---

## Flow 1: Literature Review

### Step 1: Define Scope

**Human**: Identify your research topic and what you need to know.

### Step 2: Initial Survey

(Prompt)
```
What are the seminal papers in <research field>?
- Focus on the past 5-10 years
- Include foundational work that is still relevant
- List the most influential researchers
```

### Step 3: Deep Dive

(Prompt)
```
Based on <research topic>, generate a literature review report:
- use web search
- include >30 literature citations
- organize by themes/subtopics
- in markdown format
```

### Step 4: Gap Identification

(Prompt)
```
What are the unresolved questions in <research area>?
- What methodological limitations exist?
- Where do researchers disagree?
- What emerging directions are promising?
```

---

## Flow 2: Research Question Development

### Step 1: Brainstorm

(Prompt)
```
Generate 10 specific, testable research questions about <topic>.
- Consider feasibility
- Focus on novelty
- Include both incremental and ambitious ideas
```

### Step 2: Refine

(Prompt)
```
Refine this research question to be more focused and feasible:
<broad question>

Consider:
- What makes it publishable?
- What data/methods would be needed?
- What sub-questions need to be answered first?
```

### Step 3: Frame for Impact

(Prompt)
```
How can I frame <research topic> to maximize impact?
- What journals would be interested?
- What policy/practical implications exist?
- How does it advance theoretical understanding?
```

## Flow 3: Methodology Selection

### Step 1: Survey Methods

(Prompt)
```
What methods are commonly used to study <phenomenon>?
Compare their strengths and weaknesses.
```

### Step 2: Design Study

(Prompt)
```
Design a research study to investigate: <research question>
- Recommend appropriate methodology
- Identify necessary data sources
- Estimate sample size/power requirements
- List potential validity threats
```

### Step 3: Feasibility Check

(Prompt)
```
Is this research design feasible given:
- Timeline: <duration>
- Budget: <amount>
- Resources: <available tools/data>

Suggest modifications if needed.
```

## Flow 4: Grant Proposal Planning

### Step 1: Identify Funders

(Prompt)
```
What funding agencies support research on <topic>?
- List relevant grant programs
- Note application deadlines
- Identify alignment with funder priorities
```

### Step 2: Draft Aims

(Prompt)
```
Draft specific aims for a grant proposal on <topic>:
- 3-4 interconnected aims
- Each aim should be independently valuable
- Include innovation statement
```

### Step 3: Strengthen Proposal

(Prompt)
```
What preliminary data would strengthen a proposal for <project>?
- What pilot studies are feasible?
- What existing data could be leveraged?
- How can I demonstrate expertise?
```

## Powerful Prompts for Research

```
What would <famous researcher> say about this approach?
```

```
Play devil's advocate: What are the strongest criticisms of <theory/method>?
```

```
What disciplines outside of <my field> study similar problems? What can I learn from them?
```

```
If I had unlimited resources, how would I study <question>? Now, what's the minimal viable version?
```

```
What assumptions am I making that might not hold?
```

## Tips

1. **Verify all citations**: AI may hallucinate paper titles and authors
2. **Cross-reference with databases**: Use AI as a starting point, then search Google Scholar, Semantic Scholar, etc.
3. **Stay skeptical**: AI summarizes consensus views; breakthrough ideas often challenge consensus
4. **Iterate**: Use follow-up prompts to go deeper on promising directions
5. **Document**: Keep notes on your exploration for future reference
