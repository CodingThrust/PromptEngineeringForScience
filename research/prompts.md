## Tips for Research-Focused Prompts

1. **Be Specific About Your Field**: Different disciplines have different norms and expectations.
2. **Provide Context**: Share your current understanding, constraints, and goals.
3. **Use AI for Exploration**: AI is great for brainstorming, less reliable for specific facts.
4. **Verify Everything**: Always verify claims, citations, and facts from primary sources.
5. **Iterate and Refine**: Use follow-up prompts to drill deeper into promising directions.
6. **Combine with Literature Search**: Use AI suggestions as starting points for systematic searches.
7. **Consider Multiple Perspectives**: Ask for alternative viewpoints and critiques.
